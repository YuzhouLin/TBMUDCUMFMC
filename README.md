# TBMUDCUMFMC
The code is currently being refactored to make a better interface for the training procedure.
 -- removing static referencing
 -- dynamically adapt the channel count (amputee and intact-limb have different channel configurations), so it isn't hard coded.
 -- change the appearance of the training / adaptation loop to appear more user friendly (should not change results)
 -- package matlab code more cleanly (there is a lot of unneeded code from auxillary analyses)
